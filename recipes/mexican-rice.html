        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, poblano pepper, and garlic in hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is completely coated in oil, about 2 minutes. Season with paprika, cumin, oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>

            <li>Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth and pinto beans. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>

            <li>Remove the pot from the heat, keep covered, and let stand for at least 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
